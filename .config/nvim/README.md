# Vim/Neovim configuration

This configuration focuses mostly on neovim.

## Configuration todo

- [X] Fix completion-nvim buffer completion
- [ ] Implement `<Tab>` through all buffers (and switch tabs if needed)
- [ ] Add generic interface to toggle quickfix/loclist
- [ ] Replicate `cbefore` and `cafter` behavior for nvim in lua
- [ ] Add ability to delete bad commands from history

## Plugin ideas

- [ ] Todo.txt pseudo-gui, piping commands to `todo.sh`

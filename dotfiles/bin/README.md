# Shell Functions Directory

## Purpose

This could really be called "scripts", but it is a directory in PATH which contains shell-agnostic "functions" (in Fish style).  


## Usage 

Each file must have a shebang so that an interpreter can be found.

To use, just type `filename` into the command line and let the system find the interpreter.
